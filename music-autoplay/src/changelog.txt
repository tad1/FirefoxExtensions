> It's a somehow an organized mess! and it's working! 

I created this extension to test my hypothesis: 
Can use my YouTube addiction as a trap?  to gain time and intention to work on stuff I care about?
AKA - can I exploit my weaknesses instead of constant struggle getting rid of them?


Enter 1st: I had to manually load and setup the extension (`about:debug`), I was anticipating the sudden
    burst of music.  It kinda worked.  Futher testing inquired.

I send that to the `mozilla addons` - after 10 hours they force-disabled my extension.
    I guess something was missing something in the manifest, or it was too much WIP.  Anyway I 
     have to transfer that via USB stick then.
